This repository contains scripts for the jet energy regression for H to bb decay.

Includes:

 - Preprocessing of datasets to get regression features
 - The energy regression using Gradient Boosting and the reconstruction of the invariant mass
 - A estimation of the sensitivity improvement with respect to the Jet Energy Correction (JEC)
